# Dotfiles
This directory hosts some of my dotfiles. It is currently a work in progress.

## Setup
I use [chezmoi](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi) to manage varying configs across different machines.

I also have the terminal emulator set up with the following colors (based on the
onedark vim theme):

| Color code | Color   | Color number |
| :--------: | :-----: | :----------: |
| 30         | black   | #282C34      |
| 31         | red     | #E06C75      |
| 32         | green   | #98C379      |
| 33         | yellow  | #E5C07B      |
| 34         | blue    | #61AFEF      |
| 35         | magenta | #C678DD      |
| 36         | cyan    | #56B6C2      |
| 37         | white   | #FFFFFF      |
